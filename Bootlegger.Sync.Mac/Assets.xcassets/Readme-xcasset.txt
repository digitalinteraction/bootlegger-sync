For the icon file - you can just drag AppIcon.appiconset to the Images.xcassets folder in your project.

(If you don't have one, then click on the 'use asset catalogue' button in the general settings of your target. Xcode will create one and populate it with your existing icons if you have any).

If you want the iTunes artwork, then add that manually to your bundle.
